This repository contains implementations of various machine learning techniques that utilize 
forest-based methods for optical communication applications. 
These techniques are designed to improve the performance and efficiency 
of optical communication systems. 
The methods include decision tree, random forest, 
gradient boosting, etc. and are applied to various tasks such 
as modulation recognition, channel estimation and nonlinearity compensation. 
The implementation is in Python and the user can use it to benchmark 
the performance of these techniques and apply them to their own specific use cases.
